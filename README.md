# GnumarusSceneTreeViewButtons
Adds new buttons to the scene tree view.

Currently two new buttons are added

1) Editor Comment: Every node that has a non empty editor_comment property will show up a sticky note icon. When pressed, this will select that node and open up the editor_description edit popup
2) Incomming Connections: Everny node that has one or more incoming connections will show up a "hearing ear" icon. When pressed, this will open a popup listing all current incomming connections to that node.
